## File Formats

1. **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity mockups
   - Format: PNG/SVG
   - Tool recommendations: 
     - Figma (preferred)
     - Draw.io
     - Miro

2. **High-fidelity Mockups**: Detailed designs
   - Format: PNG/SVG with source files
   - Tool recommendations:
     - Figma (preferred)
     - Sketch
     - Adobe XD

3. **Interactive Prototypes**:
   - Format: HTML/CSS/JS or Figma prototypes
   - Location: `prototypes/` directory

## Design Guidelines

1. **Naming Convention**:
   ```
   {page}-{component}-{state}-{version}.{ext}
   ```
   Example: `deployment-list-expanded-v2.svg`

2. **Version Control**:
   - Keep source files in their native format
   - Export to SVG/PNG for version control
   - Include links to editable versions (e.g., Figma URLs)

3. **Documentation**:
   - Each major UI component should have its own README
   - Include usage guidelines and interaction patterns
   - Document responsive behavior

## Key UI Sections to Design

   - Service list/grid view
   - Service details
   - Deployment status

2. **Deployment Management**
   - Deployment pipeline view
   - Configuration management
   - Environment status

3. **Monitoring & Logs**
   - Deployment logs
   - Status dashboard
   - Alert management

4. **Settings & Configuration**

   - Environment management
   - Integration settings

## Design Principles

1. **Clarity First**
   - Clear status indicators
   - Intuitive navigation
   - Consistent terminology

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Show essential information by default
   - Provide drill-down capabilities
   - Maintain context during navigation

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Mobile-friendly layouts
