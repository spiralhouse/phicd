# ADR-0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Accepted

## Context
As we begin development of AureaCore, we need to:
- Document important architectural decisions and their rationale
- Provide context for future team members and contributors
- Track the evolution of the system architecture
- Ensure consistent decision-making across the project

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions in the project.

Each ADR will include:
1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title prefixed with ADR number
2. **Status**: One of:
   - Proposed: Under discussion
   - Accepted: Approved and in effect
   - Deprecated: No longer in effect but not replaced
   - Superseded: Replaced by another ADR (reference the new ADR)

3. **Context**: 
   - Background information
   - Problem being solved
   - Forces at play
   - Constraints to consider

4. **Decision**:
   - The change being proposed
   - Detailed description of the solution
   - Implementation guidance where relevant

5. **Consequences**:
   - Positive outcomes
   - Negative outcomes
   - Risks and mitigations
   - Impact on other components

ADRs will be:
- Stored in `docs/adr/` directory
- Named using format `adr-NNNN-title.md`
- Written in Markdown
- Tracked in version control
- Reviewed through pull requests

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear documentation of architectural decisions
- Historical context preserved
- Easier onboarding for new team members
- Better understanding of system evolution
- Consistent decision-making process

### Negative
- Overhead of writing and maintaining ADRs
- Need to keep ADRs up to date
- Potential for outdated ADRs to cause confusion

## Compliance
- All significant architectural decisions must have an ADR
- ADRs must be reviewed and approved by the team
- Superseded ADRs must be marked as such and reference their replacement
- ADRs must follow the template format
